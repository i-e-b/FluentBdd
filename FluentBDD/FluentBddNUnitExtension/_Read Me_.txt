FluentBDD NUnit Extension
=========================

This extension library *MUST* be build with the "nunit.core.dll" and 
"nunit.core.interfaces.dll" libraries from the version of NUnit you
are using.


To install:
-----------
 - Build the solution
 - Copy "FluentBDD.dll" and "FluentBddNUnitExtension.dll"
   to "C:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit 2.x.x\bin\net-2.0\addins"
   (or wherever your version of NUnit is installed)
   
If you user TestRunner.Net, remember to update it's own copy of NUnit
(usually at C:\Program Files (x86)\TestDriven.NET 3\NUnit\2.5  or similar)
   
To use:
-------
Include "FluentBDD.dll" into your test project, and start writing
behaviours. NUnit will find and runs these as unit tests.


Notes and known bugs:
---------------------
ReSharper does not find tests to run, even with the extensions
installed. This has been reported to JetBrains, who intend to do nothing.
