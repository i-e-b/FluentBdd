TODO
====
 - Try to remove plugin dependency:
   - Change inheretance to include a test case, which builds test trees from classes' fields
 
 - Reduce noise introduced by 'Provable'
   - Superclasses are abstract and take a proof type
   - Maybe remove interface type proofs?
   - Remove all the provable interface stuff and just go Dynamic?
